/*
In this problem, you have to add and multiply huge numbers! These numbers are so big that you can't contain them in any ordinary data types like a long integer.

Use the power of Java's BigInteger class and solve this problem.

Input Format
------------
There will be two lines containing two numbers, "a" and "b".

Constraints
-----------
"a" and "b" are non-negative integers and can have maximum 200 digits.

Output Format
-------------
Output two lines. The first line should contain "a + b", and the second line should contain "a * b". Don't print any leading zeros.

Sample Input
------------
1234
20

Sample Output
-------------
1254
24680
